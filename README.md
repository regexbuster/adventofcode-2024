# Advent of Code 2024

## Goal

- Complete as much of the 2024 advent of code
- Do it in Go (as I want to learn Go and doing will help me learn)

## Accomplishments So Far

| Day | Stars |                                 Notes                                 |
| :-: | :---: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  1  | \*\*  |         Nothing too fancy just manipulating lists of numbers          |
|  2  | \*\*  |     Second solution is sloppy and slow but otherwise fairly easy      |
|  3  | \*\*  |                           Regex for the win                           |
|  4  | \*\*  |        A bit verbose but was shooting for clarity while coding        |
|  5  | \*\*  |    Felt really confident going in and was able to use some sorting    |
|  6  |  \*   |        Fun puzzle reminds me of a Professor Layton like puzzle        |
|  7  | \*\*  | Algorithm is inefficient but works well and I think is easy to follow |
|  8  | \*\*  |                  Fun little coordinate challenge :)                   |
